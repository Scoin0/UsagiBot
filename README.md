# UsagiBot

UsagiBot is a Twitch & Bancho IRC bot for handling song requests in Osu!

### :blue_book: Instruction

---
This version of the bot is targeting Java 8. Please have Java 8 or higher installed.

1. Download the latest version of [UsagiBot](https://github.com/Scoin0/UsagiBot/releases)
2. Extract `UsagiBot.jar` to it's own folder
3. Open notepad and create a `start.bat` script. You can copy and paste the code from below.
```
java -jar Usagibot.jar
pause
```
4. Run the newly created script once. It will create a configuration file for you. Fill out those fields and run the bot again.
    * Head over to the [configuration](https://github.com/Scoin0/UsagiBot/wiki/Configuration) wiki to learn how to configure the bot properly.
5. Everything should hopefully be working properly.
